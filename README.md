# Intoduction to Genartive AI : Course by Google 

- Learning Curve: 
  - Define Generative AI
  - Explain How Generative AI works 
  - Describe Generative AI model types
  - Describe Generative AI Applications

- AI :
	- AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

- Machine Learning :
	- ML is a subfeild of AI
	- It is a program or a sysytem that trains a model by input data.
	- The trained model can make a prediction for new data 
	- Two type of ML models: 
		- Unsepervised and supervised ML models
	- Supervised Models has a data with the labels(name,age,etc).
	- Unsupervised models has the data without lables.

- Deep Learning :
	- It is a subfield of ML.
	- Deep learning uses "Artificial Neural Nerworks" allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.
	
## Generative AI :
	- Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.
	- It uses "Artificial Neural Network can process both labelled and unlabelled data, using supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.

- Language Large Models: 
	- Its also a subset if Deep Learning,
	
-  Deep Learning Models:
	
	- Discriminative

		- Used to classify or predict

		- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data

		- Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels

	- Generative

		- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on

		- Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is

		- Predict next word in a sequence

		# Generative model generates new data instances.

## GenAI X Non-GenAI

	- Not GenAl when y is a:(output of model is)

		- Number

		- Discrete

		- Class

		- Probability

	- Is GenAl when y is:(output of model is)

		- Natural language

		- Image

		- Audio


# What is Generative Al?

	- GenAl is a type of Artificial Intelligence that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content.

	- The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model.

	- When given a prompt, GenAl uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be-and this generates new content.

# Prompt
	- prompt is a peace of text that is give to LLM(Large Language Model), it can be use to control out of model. 
	
# Prompt Design
	- it is a process to creating a prompt that genrates a desired output from LLM.
	- The quality of input determisnes the quality of output.
