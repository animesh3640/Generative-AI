  - Define Generative AI
  - Explain How Generative AI works 
  - Describe Generative AI model types
  - Describe Generative AI Applications

- AI :
	- AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

- Machine Learning :
	- ML is a subfeild of AI
	- It is a program or a sysytem that trains a model by input data.
	- The trained model can make a prediction for new data 
	- Two type of ML models: 
		- Unsepervised and supervised ML models
	- Supervised Models has a data with the labels(name,age,etc).
	- Unsupervised models has the data without lables.

- Deep Learning :
	- It is a subfield of ML.
	- Deep learning uses "Artificial Neural Nerworks" allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.
	
## Generative AI :
	- Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.
	- It uses "Artificial Neural Network can process both labelled and unlabelled data, using supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.

- Language Large Models: 
	- Its also a subset if Deep Learning,
	
-  Deep Learning Models:
	
	- Discriminative

		- Used to classify or predict

		- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data

		- Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels

	- Generative

		- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on

		- Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is

		- Predict next word in a sequence

		# Generative model generates new data instances.

## GenAI X Non-GenAI

	- Not GenAl when y is a:(output of model is)

		- Number

		- Discrete

		- Class

		- Probability

	- Is GenAl when y is:(output of model is)

		- Natural language

		- Image

		- Audio


# What is Generative Al?

	- GenAl is a type of Artificial Intelligence that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content.

	- The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model.

	- When given a prompt, GenAl uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be-and this generates new content.

# Prompt
	- prompt is a peace of text that is give to LLM(Large Language Model), it can be use to control out of model. 
	
# Prompt Design
	- it is a process to creating a prompt that genrates a desired output from LLM.
	- The quality of input determisnes the quality of output.

# Model Types 
	
 	- text-to-text

		- Text-to-text models take a natural language input and produce text output. These models are trained to learn the mapping between a pair of texts (e.g. translation from one language to another).

	- Text-to-image 
		- Text-to-image models are relatively new and are trained on a large set of images, each captioned with a short text description. Diffusion is one method used to achieve this.

	- text-to-video, text-to-3D

		- Text-to-video models aim to generate a video representation from text input. The input text can be anything from a single sentence to a full script, and the output is a video that corresponds to the input text. Similarly Text-to-3D models generate three-dimensional objects that correspond to a user's text description (for use in games or other 3D worlds)

# Question Answer 

	- Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect. What are some factors that can cause hallucinations? Select three options.
		- The model is trained on noisy or dirty data.
		- The model is not trained on enough data
		- The model is not given enough context.

	- What is a prompt?
		-A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.

	- What is Generative AI?
		- Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video.

	- What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?
		- A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

	- What are foundation models in Generative AI?
		- A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data that was "designed to be adapted” (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.
